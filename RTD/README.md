# RTD Examples: Segway and Rover

This repository contains code for the paper, ["Bridging the Gap Between Safety and Real-Time Performance in Receding-Horizon Trajectory Design for Mobile Robots"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06746), which introduces **Reachability-based Trajectory Design**, or RTD.

Check out the [tutorial](https://github.com/skousik/RTD_tutorial) to get a gentler introduction to the method. This repository follows the tutorial, but for the Segway and Rover instead of for the Turtlebot.

#### Getting Started

All the code in this repository runs in MATLAB (R2018a or newer).

This repository contains almost everything you need to start playing with RTD. The other things you will need are:

1. To run the simulations and most of the code, you'll need a copy of our [simulator](https://github.com/skousik/simulator) repository on your MATLAB path.

2. To run the reachable set computations, you'll need [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) (free for academic use).

3. To run the NMPC planner in the comparison code, you'll need to get [GPOPS](http://www.gpops2.com/) (free for academic use).
