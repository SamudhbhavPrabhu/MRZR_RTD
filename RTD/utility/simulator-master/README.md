# simulator

This is a set of tools for simulating a rigid body robot in MATLAB. The three key components for this simulator are:

1) Agent: the robot to be simulated. See agent.m for an overview.

2) Planner/s: the planning algorithm/s that are used to navigate the agent through a simulated environment. See planner.m for the overview.

3) World/s: the environment/s that the agent must navigate through. See world.m for an overview.

Note that this version of the simulator is from 12 April 2020, and is packaged with this repo to make it a standalone repository.
